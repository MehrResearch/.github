## Who are we?
We are a group of scientists and engineers on a mission to re-imagine fundamental aspects of chemistry — composition, reactivity, and discovery — in the context of the possibilities in information processing and automation available today. Find out more about us [here][group website].

### Working together
We love open source and welcome new ideas and contributions. Feel free to open issues and submit pull requests. If you like what we do, it would be lovely to hear from you.
